                    and bassist Hugh McDonald. Previous bassist Alec John Such was dismissed in 1994, and longtime guitarist

                    In 1984 and 1985, Bon Jovi released their first two albums and their debut single "Runaway"
                    managed to crack the Top 40. In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition
                    with their third album, Slippery When Wet, which sold over 20 million copies and included three Top 10
                    singles, two of which reached No. 1 ("You Give Love a Bad Name" and "Livin' on a Prayer")
                    Their fourth album, New Jersey (1988), was also very successful, selling over 10 million copies
                    and featuring five Top 10 singles (a record for a hard rock album), two of which reached No. 1
                    ("Bad Medicine" and "I'll Be There for You"). After the band toured and recorded extensively during
                    the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988â€“90 New Jersey Tour, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released
                    successful solo albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively.
